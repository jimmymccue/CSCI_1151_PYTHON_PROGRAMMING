In software testing, the term "full coverage" typically means achieving 100% code 
coverage every line, branch, or condition in the code has been executed by tests. While 
this might sound ideal, it’s important to understand what that really means and whether 
it’s a practical goal for every project.  Full coverage can increase confidence in the 
code and catch untested or unreachable sections. It’s especially important in safety 
critical systems like medical devices or aviation software, where every possible path 
must be verified. In these cases, full coverage might even be required by law or 
industry standards. However, in most projects, aiming for 100% coverage may not be worth 
the effort. Some code, like basic getters or error messages, doesn’t add much value when 
tested. Also, high coverage doesn’t guarantee all edge cases or behaviors are properly 
tested it just means the code ran. So while full coverage can be useful, it's often 
better to aim for meaningful coverage that focuses on critical paths and likely failure 
points.
