Stepwise refinement, also known as top-down design, is a programming technique where a 
complex problem is broken down into smaller more manageable parts through a series of 
successive refinements. A programmer starts with a high level description of what the 
program needs to accomplish and then divides this into major sub tasks. Each sub task 
is further decomposed into even smaller tasks until the steps become simple enough to 
be directly translated into code. This method helps programmers handle complexity by 
isolating individual components making the development process more organized and less 
overwhelming. It also improves code clarity and maintainability by encouraging modular 
design where each module or function has a clearly defined responsibility. Stepwise 
refinement facilitates easier testing and debugging because programmers can verify each 
small piece independently before integrating everything together. It also supports 
collaboration as team members can work on different modules at the same time without 
confusion. Stepwise refinement helps programmers write cleaner, more efficient, and 
maintainable code by guiding them through a structured problem-solving approach.
