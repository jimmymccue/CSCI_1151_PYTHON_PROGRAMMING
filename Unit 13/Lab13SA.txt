In Chapter 14, the question comes up about why the author uses triple-quoted strings 
also known as docstrings for classes and functions like in the Button class example. 
These docstrings actually play a big role in helping programmers with their workflow. 
They act like built-in notes that explain what a class, method or function is supposed 
to do. This makes it way easier to understand code at a glance, especially when you 
come back to it after some time or if someone else wrote it. Instead of having to read 
through every line to figure out what’s going on you get a clear summary right at the 
top. Tools like Python’s help() function or code editors like VSCode can pull in those 
docstrings and show them automatically, which is super convenient. They also come in 
handy for generating documentation without extra effort. So even though they seem small
docstrings really help keep code readable, organized and efficient to work with.
