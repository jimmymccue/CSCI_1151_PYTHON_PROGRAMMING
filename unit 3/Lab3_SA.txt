How are the while loop and for loop similar and different?

In Python, for loops and while loops are both code structures used to execute a 
block of code multiple times. They are similar in that they allow repetition and 
support flow control features such as break to exit the loop early, continue to 
skip to the next iteration, and an optional else clause that runs if the loop 
completes normally without encountering a break. Despite their similarities, for 
and while loops differ in how they control repetition. A for loop is designed to 
iterate over a sequence such as a list, tuple, dictionary, string, or a range 
object. It is typically used when the number of iterations is known ahead of time or 
when working directly with elements in a collection. On the other hand, a while 
loop continues to run as long as a specified condition remains true. It is more 
suitable for scenarios where the number of repetitions cannot be determined in advance.
