The groupcollide() function in Pygame is used to check for collisions 
between two groups of sprites. In the case of Chapter 13, it's used to 
see if any bullets fired from the rocket ship hit the alien ships. You 
give it two sprite groups like bullets and aliens and it will go through 
and figure out which sprites from each group are touching. If it finds a 
match, it returns a dictionary showing which bullets hit which aliens.
There are also two optional settings that let you decide whether or not 
to delete the bullet, the alien, or both when a collision happens. In our 
project we want both to disappear when they collide so we set both of 
those options to True. This method makes handling collisions way easier 
especially when there are lots of objects on the screen at once. Itâ€™s 
also worth noting that groupcollide() checks collisions based on the 
rectangular area of each sprite, so having accurate rect values is 
important for proper detection.
