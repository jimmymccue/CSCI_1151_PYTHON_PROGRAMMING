Colormaps are a great way to turn data into something we can 
easily understand by using colors. In Python, tools like 
Matplotlib make it simple to apply colormaps to things like 
temperature or rainfall. For example, cooler temperatures are 
often shown in blue, while hotter ones shift toward red, something 
that just makes sense visually. Rainfall is usually shown in
shades from green to purple with heavier rain getting darker 
colors. Agencies like NASA and NOAA use these techniques to help 
people quickly see where extreme weather is happening. One cool 
example is the Global Precipitation Measurement project, which 
maps rainfall intensity around the world using color. In Python, 
you can customize how your data looks by using the cmap= argument 
in your plots—for instance, cmap='coolwarm' for temperature data 
or cmap='viridis' for general use. It’s a simple way to make 
trends and patterns in your data much easier to spot.
