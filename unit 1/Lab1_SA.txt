When naming and using variables in Python, there are a few best practices to keep in mind. 
Variable names should only contain letters, numbers, and underscores, and they must start with a letter 
or an underscore and not a number. You can’t use spaces in variable names, so it’s better to use 
underscores to separate words, like “greeting_message” and running the words together like “greetingmessage” 
could get confusing. It’s also important to avoid using Python’s keywords or built-in function names, 
such as print, as variable names. Good variable names are usually short but still describe what the variable 
is used for. For example, user_name is more helpful than just u_n. It’s also a good idea to avoid using 
letters like lowercase l or uppercase O because they can look like the numbers 1 and 0. Even though Python 
lets you use uppercase letters in variable names, it’s better to stick with lowercase since uppercase names 
are used for constants.  You should also be careful not to confuse the variable name when calling it.
