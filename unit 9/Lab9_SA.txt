Refactoring is the process of improving the internal structure of code without changing 
its behavior. In Python, this can include renaming variables for clarity, breaking large 
functions into smaller ones, and organizing code into logical classes or modules. Refactoring 
often aligns with the S.O.L.I.D. principles, which help developers toward write clean, 
maintainable object-oriented code. For example, the Single Responsibility Principle encourages 
each function or class to have one clear purpose. Refactoring helps achieve this by separating 
responsibilities that may have been combined. Similarly, the Open/Closed Principle suggests that 
code should be open for extension but closed for modification. Through refactoring, developers 
can create flexible designs that support new features without rewriting existing logic. The 
benefits of refactoring include improved readability, easier debugging, and better long-term 
maintainability. By regularly refactoring code with these principles in mind, developers create 
cleaner, more professional applications that are easier to scale and collaborate on.
