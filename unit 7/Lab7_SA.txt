Function reuse is really helpful for programmers because it saves time and makes code 
easier to manage and maintain. Instead of writing the same code over and over, we can 
just write a function once and use it wherever we need it. This not only makes our 
programs shorter and cleaner, but also helps avoid mistakes and makes debugging much 
easier. If we need to fix or change something, we only have to update it in one place, 
which is a big time saver. It also makes the code more organized and easier to 
understand, especially when working on bigger projects or with a team. To reuse 
functions, we can put them in separate files or modules and import them when needed. 
We can also create shared modules or use ones that are already available through Python. 
Function reuse is a smart and effective way to write better code and keep everything 
more efficient and professional.
