CSV and JSON are both ways to store and share data, but they’re pretty different. CSV is 
super simple: it just has rows of data with commas separating each value. It’s great for 
spreadsheets or any data that’s basically a table with rows and columns. But it can’t 
handle anything complicated like nested information. JSON, on the other hand, uses 
key-value pairs and can store more complex data like lists inside lists or objects 
inside objects, so it’s perfect when you need to represent things with more structure. 
For CSV, the best data types are simple ones like strings, integers, and floats since 
everything is stored as plain text. With JSON, you can use not only those but also 
booleans, arrays, and even nested objects, which makes it way more flexible for more 
detailed data. That’s why JSON is often used in web development and APIs, while CSV is 
great for simple data exports.
