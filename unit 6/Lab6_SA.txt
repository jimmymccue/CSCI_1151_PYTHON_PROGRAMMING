In Python, you are not required to use the loop variable inside the body of a for loop. 
Sometimes, the loop variable is simply there to help repeat an action a certain number of 
times, and it may not be used at all. In such cases, Python developers often use an 
underscore _ to indicate that the variable isn’t needed. For example, if you want to print 
"Hello" five times, you might write:

for _ in range(5):
    print("Hello")

This helps make your intention clear—that you’re looping just for repetition, not because 
you need the value of the variable. While you technically must declare a loop variable in a 
for loop, you have the flexibility not to reference it within the loop’s body. This is useful 
for creating cleaner, more readable code when the loop index or value is irrelevant to the 
logic being executed within the loop.
